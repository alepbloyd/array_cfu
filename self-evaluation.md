#Self Evaluation

##Confidence Level

 - I feel confident with the concept of arrays and calling different methods on arrays with an understanding of what effects they'll have on the array and what they'll return. I also feel pretty confident in reading basic documentation if I don't understand or know how a method works.

##Additional Learning

 - Arrays are neat and I plan on doing some more reading of the documentation or looking for other resources on useful methods.

##Additional Questions about Arrays

 - No specific questions about arrays, but is there a way to write Ruby in atom and check that methods are working as expected, without tabbing over to terminal, starting irb session, and copying over?
